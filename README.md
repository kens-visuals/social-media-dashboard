### What I learned

I learned a lot of new and awesome stuff, and I'm really pumped about how this project came out. At first, I was wandering around the Internet to find an article, a video, something that will help to help me to build this project with SCSS and its features. However, if you've done a similar project, you know that most of the tutorials out there suggest using CSS variables. I didn't want to use that technique, since it would make my code pretty messy and mixed up with two technologies, CSS and SASS. So, I kept searching, and I ran across a couple of articles, which were really helpful, but they were lacking a couple of details. Finally, after hours of testing and reading, I came up with my own way of accomplishing this concept. I used SASS, `mixins` and I've got to admit that this came out to be a lot easier than I anticipated it to be. Although it took a several hours and bunch of small projects in CodePen to test things out before coding the actual project, but it was all worth it.

### Continued development

I'm planning on writing an article in a more detailed manner, to better explain this technique and how it could potentially make adding a theme to your existing website or creating a one from scratch a lot easier.
